#+title: =tplisp=
#+options: toc:nil num:nil

=tplisp= is a minimalistic interepter of an extremely limited (at the
moment) subset of R5RS Scheme. Currently supported:

- Quoting (keyword *and* single-quote syntax)
- Eval (=tpeval()= -- reuses the built-in eval)
- Proper lexically scoped environments & closures
- Vectors (keyword *and* hash syntax)
- =apply=, and various other built-ins

Not currently supported:

- Macros
- Tail recursion
- Call-with-current-continuation (call/cc)
- Dotted-tail notation

The upshot is that Perl will moan at you if you recurse too
deeply. Also, if you construct a vector that looks too much like a
linked list (nested cons cells), the repl's pretty-printer will get
confused (the actual data is safe though).
